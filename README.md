# HTML Validator & Previewer

This is a Next.js application that allows users to upload a ZIP file containing creative assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images), validate them against a set of rules, and see a live, sandboxed preview.

## Getting Started Locally

To get this project up and running on your local machine, please follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system (version 18 or higher is recommended). Installing Node.js will also install `npm`, the Node package manager.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:** If you haven't already, get the code onto your machine.
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:** Run the following command to install all the required packages from `package.json`.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server with this command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application with Turbopack for faster performance. You'll see output in your terminal telling you that the server is running.

You can now view the application by opening your web browser and navigating to:

[http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002)

The application will automatically reload if you make any edits to the source files.
